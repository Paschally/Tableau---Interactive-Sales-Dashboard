Interactive Sales Dashboard for U.S. Retail – Tableau Project

In this project, I built a comprehensive sales dashboard using Tableau to analyze publicly available retail data focused on the U.S. market. 
The dataset, includes historical sales transactions across multiple states, product categories, and customer segments.

The goal was to demonstrate core competencies in the use of Tableau, including data preparation, dashboard design, and the ability to extract actionable insights from complex datasets.
I began by cleaning and shaping the data, ensuring consistency in date formats, product categories, and location data.
Then, I developed an interactive dashboard with key KPIs such as total sales, profit margin, sales by region, Year-on-Year comparison, monthly performance trends, etc. 
Users can filter by time period, state, category, and customer segment, allowing for dynamic exploration of the data.

Beyond visualization, I incorporated color-encoded charts, parameter controls, map views, and trendlines to improve user engagement and insight delivery. 
This dashboard supports better strategic planning and performance monitoring for sales teams and executives.

This project reflects my ability to turn raw data into intuitive, insight-rich dashboards—essential for any data-driven business environment.
